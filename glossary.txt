dhone pata: cilantro seeds

millequoi: [some french thing. @labmouse, help!]

phoron: aromatics and spices, usually tossed into the oil first

paanch phoron: five indian spices (fenugreek aka methi, cumin aka "shado jire", coriander, onionseed aka "kalo jire", fennel). This one time I found a premade spice mix of all five seeds, and that was great. The menugreek/onionseed/cumin is the most important part. Optionally, use some dhone pata.

sorshe phoron: mustard seeds

sorche batta: a mustard sauce. Soak mustard seeds in water over night, and then run the seeds through a blender with some water.

jire: cumin (powder). Sometimes "shado jire" / "white jire".

methi: fenugreek
