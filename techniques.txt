Cooking your spices: you want to unlock the flavor! Most commonly, I heat oil on medium (or low) heat, and add the spices once things are warm. Some people want the spices to pop, but I find that can be a bit too long. Heat + oil + raw spices = spiced goodness. Toasting + grinding the spices is another way, but takes longer (and oil is tasty).
