Mangos. Get them sour (i.e. a little bit green) and cut them up into bitesize pieces. Accept that any mangos in the US will be sweet, and not sour, even the "sour mangos" in the Indian supermarket.

In a pan: heat some oil, and cook the raw spices (garam masala: cinnamon, cloves, cardamom). Add ginger. Once this is all infused, add white vinegar (2/3 cup), a bit of salt, and quite a lot of sugar. Let it cook, and adjust the sugar to taste. It should taste sweet. (Note: no water has been added above!)

Once the vinegar is boiling, add the mangos, cover, lower heat, and cook until the mangos are "glassy".

You could add some green chilis once it's half-cooked. If it's dry near the end, add some water while it's still cooking.
