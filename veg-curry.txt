pick 3-5 veg:
  potato + (sweetsquash|carrot) + (eggplant, cabbage, cauliflower, bellpeppers, greenbeans)

spices:
  pickling spices: (seeds) fenugreek, cumin, coriander, onionseed, fennel
  mustard paste: mustard powder + water

cooking eggplant:
  it soaks up oil! careful.
  coat in salt, and leave; separate the dark (and bitter) water that leaks out
  you probably want to cook the eggplant separately

cooking vegetables:
  just like stirfry, you want similarly cut veg (though not necessarily the same size)
  you want the pace when you put veg in vs the size of the cuts
  size/shape of the cuts will affect the taste
  it's more important that everything is totally cooked

how to start with pickling spices:
  a little oil, low/med heat until it's smoking
  when it starts popping, it's ready to ad more stuff

cooking:
  heat the pickling spices
  add vegetables and toss so all is covered in oil
  add a pinch in turmeric, maybe ginger
  add salt & sugar; mix more
  cover and let simmer in low heat
    option: throw in tomatoes halfway through its cooking
  add mustard paste at very end

alternatives to mustard paste:
  1 can garganzo beans, sweet coconut flakes, sautee until brown, add

possible kohlrabi notes?
  spices: turmeric, cinnamon?
  go with younger kohlrabi if possible
