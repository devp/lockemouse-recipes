Balance heaviness/lightness of protein/vegetables.
Tougher veg (broccoli, green beans): blanch first. 2-3 min in water at a rolling boil.
Bell peppers: add in very late.
Cut up ingredients in the same shape.

(2) Three Aromatics
heroic trio: garlic, ginger, scallions

fineness of cut = strength of aromatics
NOTE: if minced (esp. garlic), burns quickly. add them on top of the protein to ease them in.

rice wine, dry sherry, rice vinegar, toasted sesame oil, and chile garlic sauce
