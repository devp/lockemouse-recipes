Mix: in a bowl.
- 1 1/2 cups flour
- 3 tbsp sugar
- 1 3/4 tsp baking powder
- 1/4 tsp salt

or Mix: in a 2-quart tupperware container.
- 6 cups flour
- 1/4 cup sugar
- 2 generous tbsp baking powder
- 1 tsp salt

Set your griddle to preheat. If your griddle is a frying pan on an electric stove, put it at like 5 or 6.

In one bowl, put:
- around 2 cups of dry mix

In another bowl, mix:
- 3 tbsp vegetable oil
- 2 egg yolks [SEPARATE THE EGGS!]
- 1 1/4 cups beverage

In a third bowl, put:
- 2 egg whites [SEPARATE THE EGGS!]

To the egg whites, add:
- a pinch of cream of tartar
(or substitute a pinch of baking powder, which has cream of tartar in it and will do the same thing, no harm done.)

And beat those whites to firm peaks. [Use a wire wisk and do it by hand!!]

Hold the wire wisk between your two palms, wisk part down in the bowl. Spin it back and forth as fast as you can, like you're trying to start a fire. The egg whites whip up in less than a minute, it's easy and very cool and again you get to look like the cooking stud.

Now stir the oil, yolks and beverage into the dry mix. Don't beat it or blend it. Stir it in with a wooden spoon, gently, until it's evenly wet and lumpy and there's no clumps of dry mix at the bottom of the bowl.

Then fold in the whipped whites. 'Fold' means even more gently. You don't want to crush those tiny little frothy bubbles of air. Stir it until the whites look mostly incorporated.

Did I mention preheating your griddle? It should be hot by now. Let the whole production sit for a couple of minutes. Now's a great time to squeeze the orange juice.

(Turn your kmart frying pan back up to 5 or 6.) Put butter on your griddle and ladle on a good like 1/3 cup of batter. Watch it, hopping from foot to foot, until it's bubbly in the middle, then turn it over. Give it a bit and then peek at the bottom. If it's done, don't put it on whoever's plate has been standing there hopping foot to foot with you, tear it in half with your fingers and eat some. That's to find out if you need to correct the batter. It also drives your lover simply frantic with anticipation.

If the batter's too runny, add flour. If it's too thick, add beverage. It should be just like, just like what. Like perfect batter. You'll know it when you see it.

Make your corrections if you need to and then cook the rest. Serve them as they come off the griddle, don't stack them up and serve them all together or they'll steam themselves rubbery.

Oh, but wait! 1 1/4 cups beverage? What the heck?

Milk is what the Joy says, milk is easy and obvious. Don't use milk. At the very least, use half milk and half seltzer. (Half milk and half seltzer pancakes taste a little empty, but they have a texture that's pure delight.) (Maybe one of these days I'll try half cream and half seltzer.)

Half milk and half apple cider will rock your world, and your lover will vulch over your shoulder and ask if you're really going to finish that and maybe could you share just one more bite?

I haven't tried orange juice or rootbeer, but both have potential.

Beer is ideal. Much as I like beer, whenever I buy one I consider it for pancakes first.

Sam Adams cream stout is good, but mix it half with milk or your pancakes will just taste like Sam Adams cream stout. Which there are worse fates, really.

Same's true generally of stouts and porters.

Belgian-style white beers are excellent and sort of general purpose for pancakes, unmixed with milk. But save pilsners for your onion ring batter. Never had pilsner pancakes I liked.

What is it, Post Road pumpkin ale? I haven't tried it to drink, but it certainly makes good pancakes.

And those like raspberry wheat or cherry wheat or blueberry beers that there's no good use for, here's the best possible use for them. There's a local-ish Sea Dog blueberry beer that, with frozen wild blueberries tossed in, makes pancakes that -- I can't tell you. Your children sing your praises in lovely boys' choir harmony and your lover gives you stormy sultry looks across the kitchen table.

But better even is Pete's summer brew, and add a generous three-finger pinch of ground coriander to the batter. It'll be the land of nookie but you'll be like, not now, dear. I have to finish my pancakes.
