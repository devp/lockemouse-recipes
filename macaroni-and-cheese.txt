It's easy!

Take a package of ramen noodles. Place in a bowl of water and microwave for a minute. Drain.

Then place the drained noodles in a bowl. Layer 2-4 slices of american cheese.

Microwave again, stir it up, and you're done!

Remix it, international-style! Add some salsa, siracha or catchup to the top.
