A savory meat dish. I'm not sure what the equivalent is from Indian restaurants, but it's similar to rogan josh.

...

Sautee in oil: garlic, ginger, onions. (Can use minced garlic/ginger from a jar.) Add spices: bay leaves, cloves, black peppercorns, cardamom pods. (The combination o spices is surprisingly sweet.)

As it starts to cook: chili powder and paprika. Add enough turmeric to make it delightfully yellow. Add more oil if necessary so that there's enough oil for the meat. Continue to sautee down.

Add some chunks of lamb. (Or: other meats.) Stir it around so that things are covered, and cook the lamb for a bit. A good proto-sauce should be forming.

Add a small can of tomato sauce and some water to get a good sauce quantity/thickness.

Stir, cover, and let simmer until meat is cooked entirely. Cooking times:

* Lamb: ~1hr?
* Beef: ~2hr??
* Pork: ?
* Chicken: ?
