Mangos. Get them sour (i.e. a little bit green) and cut them up into bitesize pieces. Accept that any mangos in the US will be sweet, and not sour, even the "sour mangos" in the Indian supermarket.

Sorche Batta: a mustard sauce. In desperation, you could add water to mustard powder, but it'll suck. The better way to do it: soak mustard seeds in water over night, and then run the seeds through a blender with some water.

Heat oil, add raw spices (fenugreek and dried red chilis), then add mango. Cover, lower heat, and let cook.

When the mangos are half-soft, add the powdered spices (chili powder, and optionally jire and maybe even turmeric) and half the sorche batta. Add sugar and salt to taste. Add some water, cover and simmer.

A few minutes before it's done, add the rest of the sorche batta and some mustard oil.
