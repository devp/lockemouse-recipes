A savory fried rice with cauliflower and potatoes that's great for brunch.

...

This is based on chere rice, which is a flattened kind of rice that looks like rice flakes. There is thick and thin chere, and you want the thin kind.

Cut up some cauliflower and potatoes to taste. Remember to keep the potato moderately small so that it will actually cook through.

Rinse the chere and pour our the extra water. It should be wet now, and that will let it expand a bit. Add some salt, sugar and termeric, and mix it together. Let it sit.

Cut up some minced ginger, and a few chilis. (You can cut one chili in half, and that'll basically be good.)

Heat up the oil in the frying pan, and add some phoron (either paanch or sorshe) and dried chili. Progressively add the potato and, once that's cooked a bit, the cauliflower. Add a dash of salt and turmeric to this, and then garlic and chili once the cauliflower has cooked a little. Lower the heat, cover and let cook some more. Remember to stir it if you can.

Meanwhile, the chere rice shall have expanded.

Then... Well we're still in the middle of the recipe at the moment.
